# Mini Project 1 - ProgBar

> A Simple Progress Bar for Rust Iterators

[`ProgBar`](https://docs.rs/zung_mini/latest/zung_mini/progbar/index.html) module is a lightweight and customizable progress bar library for Rust iterators. It allows you to easily track the progress of any iterator in your terminal with visual feedback. Whether your iterator is bounded (has a known size) or unbounded (infinite loop), `ProgBar` adapts to display the progress accordingly.

## Features

- **Simple Integration**: Easily add progress bars to any iterator with minimal code changes.
- **Supports Bounded & Unbounded Iterators**: Progress can be tracked for both finite and infinite iterators.
- **Customizable Appearance**: Modify the style and delimiters of the progress bar.
- **Real-time Terminal Display**: Live updates of the progress bar in the terminal as your iterator progresses.

## Usage

See the [docs](https://docs.rs/zung_mini/latest/zung_mini/progbar/index.html) for how to use this library.
